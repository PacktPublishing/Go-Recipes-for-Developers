## Instructions and Navigations

Some code may appear slightly different between the Chapter and the Repository. While the functionality remains the same, the code is not exactly identical. For example, in Chapter 5: in one instance, it is referred to as 'Package Auth' in the Chapter, whereas it is 'Package Main' in the Repository to ensure the code is executable.

All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chp2.

The code will look like the following:

```
ctx:=context.Background()
cancelable, cancel:=context.WithCancel(ctx)
defer cancel()
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for any developer with a basic understanding of the Go language. If youâ€™re a senior developer, you can use it as a reference for finding useful examples they can apply to different use cases..
